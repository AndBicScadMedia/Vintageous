TODO
====

* unify handling of state in _* commands: use either parameters or VintageState.
	- VintageState must be used so that macros started in different modes work ok
* improve <count>%: s.a must be inclusive in reversed motions
* improve w in visual mode when starting on an empty line
* some commands need to reorient the caret, like F, T, gg, etc. to include the current char in visual mode
* bug in D: in normal mode, empty lines shouldn't be deleted
* bug in C: in nomrmal mode, empty lines shouldn't be deleted
* improve jumplist: enable jumplist for unsaved buffers
* implement visual mode for H, L, M

* simplify .reorient_caret() and make it more similar to other execution hooks

DONE
===
* improve <count>G and <count>gg
* improve f, t, F, T: add support for counts
* improve . command: make it accept a count
* cancel action if selections didn't change after motion: this is a bug in dfx, for instance
* get rid of _internal_mode: make it a first-class mode
