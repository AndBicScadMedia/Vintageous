TODO
====

* implement <count>%
* implement f, t, F, T: add support for counts
* improve <count>G and <count>gg
* improve w in visual mode when starting on an empty line
* some commands need reorienting the caret, like F, T, gg, etc. to include the current char in visual mode

* simplify .reorient_caret() and make it more similar to other execution hooks
